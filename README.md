# magicCalculator

First real Flutter project

## What it does

A non-functional calculator only meant to return a predefined value.
When using the app, click the history and enter the value you want,
click enter and watch as the output field ignores all rules of math.

## But why?

As my first flutter project based on [Mike boyds magical calculator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W89i7qqhuLQ)
Simple meant to fuck with your friends, save yourself some embarrassment,
when blurting out a wrong math equation.
The possibilities are almost endless (not really)...
